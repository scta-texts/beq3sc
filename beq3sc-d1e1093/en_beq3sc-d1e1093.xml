          Whether some proposition is able to be composed 
          from the intentions and species 
          naturally signifying in the some external thing.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e120">
          One says that here that 
          there is a double mental propositions in the soul, 
          one corresponding to the vocal proposition, 
          and another corresponding to the written proposition, 
          which differ in species 
          because it is impossible that one thing is a natural likeness
          <cb ed="#P" n="b"/>
          of two things distinct in species 
          because a natural likeness 
          and that of which it is a likeness 
          are of the same species. 
          But a mental proposition 
          and a written proposition 
          differ in species, 
          therefore.
          Through a similar reason 
          it is proven that the mental propositions differ in species 
          which nevertheless correspond to the propositions in writing 
          because many propositions in writing differ in species 
          because some are in stone, 
          some in wood. 
          But all mental propositions corresponding to vocal words 
          are of the same species.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e164">
          Again, 
          according to them, 
          no mental proposition should be posited 
          unless it is composed from terms 
          which are natural likenesses of the written or mentioned terms. 
          Whence from the species which they posit,
          the natural likeness of things, 
          like of man and things of this type,
          no proposition is composed, 
          but only from terms which are natural likeness of what is vocalized or written 
          which terms indeed signify things ad placitum,
          which are signified through vocalized words or what is written, 
          though these utterances and things written signify naturally. 
          And therefore 
          every mental propositions in the whole world 
          corresponds, according to him, to some idiom or to something written. 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e199">
          And from this he concludes 
          that this description of a mental term 
          is not valid 
          because the mental term is an understanding or passion 
          of the soul signifying something able to be part of a mental proposition 
          because such terms are not parts of the mental proposition.
          This opinion is argued thus, 
          a terminus signifies nothing naturally 
          because in the definition of the name and word 
          it is the case that it signifies ad placitum, 
          see book 1 of the <title>Peryhermenias</title>.
          It is said there that name and word are defined in one voice.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e237">
          On the contrary: 
          to the logic it is pertinent to determine about the proposition 
          and the mental term attributes to these, 
          and these does not happen elsewhere, 
          therefore it happens there.
          Furthermore, 
          though the one defining man 
          intendes to define true man and not an fictiious man, 
          nevertheless 
          just as fictious man is called man improperly, 
          so it is called a rational animal improperly.
          Similarly,
          though he intends there to define such things in voice, 
          nevertheless if the things defined are found in the intellect, 
          then the definitions are suitable to them, 
          therefore every mental names signifies as desired.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e272">
          Again, 
          everyone experiences in themselves 
          that they are able to form such propositions 
          before they speak them and signifying the terms as desired, 
          whence the one who knew the Latin 
          forms Latin propositions.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e290">
          Again, 
          to every word/noun corresponds to a mental propositions, 
          therefore to this term <mentioned>being</mentioned> corresponds <mentioned>being is one</mentioned>, 
          therefore a mental term corresponds to the subject 
          which naturally signifies everything. 
          The consequent is false 
          because that something is the natural sign of something
          only happens in three ways 
          because 
          either is the cause of it
          or the effect of it 
          or the natural likeness of it, 
          none of which belong to the mental term 
          with respect to every thing.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e325">
          Again, 
          the pilgrim forms this: 
          <mentioned>God is three and one</mentioned>,
          therefore the mental term corresponding to the subject 
          will be a natural sign of God.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e338">
          Again, 
          <supplied>regarding</supplied> the subject of that proposition 
          in the mind, every quality <supplied>which</supplied> would inhere in the subject, 
          would be a natural likeness of every quality, 
          which is impossible 
          because by virtue of the fact that it is 
          a natural likeness of one 
          it is a natural dislikeness of the other.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e352">
          Again, it is the case concerning the ratio of the word 
          that it understood from what is informing, 
          but when I form the word color, no one experiences 
          having the word of contrary things 
          and natural likeness of the same thing, 
          therefore etc.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e368">
          Again, having posited a single word of whiteness, 
          the intellect is able to form the following, 
          <mentioned>whiteness is whiteness</mentioned>, 
          therefore there are 
          two natural likeness of all whitenesses.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e377">

              indeed that this cognition of itself

          Therefore such a likeness born in the soul 
          is truly of the same species with it, 
          then it follows that any soul would produce 
          and infinity of rational souls, 
          and when the rational soul creations in this mode alone, 
          it follows that the soul is able to create.

          from the beginning of the world, 
          nor are these men able to laugh, 
          and as a consequence they are not risible, 
          nor will God every judge them

          Again,

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e658">
          He also puts the same 
          that cognition is a cognitive potency 
          which is the soul itself. 
          Whence human cognition is nothing unless
          the soul knowing. 
          Nevertheless, 
          this term <mentioned>cognition</mentioned>, 
          as he says, 
          when it is taken for a thing 
          by which the one knowing, 
          is formally the one knowing.
          Sometimes it is taken for the likeness (similitudine???) of the known thing, 
          and sometimes for the thing known.
          In the first mode 
          it is called formal cognition, 
          in the second mode 
          material or objectively immediate, 
          in the third mode, 
          material or objectively mediate.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e686">
          Again, 
          he distinguishes this term <mentioned>cognitive</mentioned> 
          because when it is taken as the efficient cause of cognitions, 
          sometimes it is for what is receptive of cognition, 
          sometimes for that by which something is formally able to be known.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e703">
          Therefore his first conclusion is this: 
          every human cognition taken in the first mode 
          is a cognitive potency. 
          This is proved thus, 
          if cognition were a quality super-added 
          through divine potency, 
          it would be able to put in a stone, 
          and thus what is not-cognitive 
          would know. 
          Nor is it valid to say 
          that this quality 
          is not able to be 
          a formal perfection of the stone 
          because human nature 
          is in the divine person 
          and nevertheless does not perfect it formally 
          and this not withstanding 
          he names it formally according to 
          its 
          <cb ed="#P" n="b"/>
          properties.

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e730">
          Again, 
          color is formally seen through vision, 
          therefore, when color and vision are conserved, 
          it will always be true:
          color is seen, 
          therefore, having destroyed the visible potency, 
          this will be true, 
          true color is seen.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e744">
          Again, when something is of some such thing 
          through another, 
          this other thing is such a thing through itself.
          But the cognitive potency 
          is formally knowing through cognition, 
          therefore cognition formally knows itself.
          Therefore, 
          when cognitive or intellective potency has been destroyed,
          a understanding would understand. <!-- translation check; confusing here -->
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e751">
          Again, 
          it is impossible that contradictory respective predicates 
          are verified successively about something 
          without making any change regarding the thing 
          about from which they are being verified, 
          nor regarding the thing with respect to which it is verified. 
          But these predicates, <mentioned>understanding</mentioned>, 
          <mentioned>non-understanding</mentioned>, 
          are contradictory respective predicates, 
          therefore it is impossible that this is verified a
          about a quality which is called <mentioned>understanding</mentioned>
          without any change being made, etc. 
          Therefore, 
          if the intellective potency is destroyed 
          and the object and quality is conserved, 
          then this will be true: 
          if it is formed, 
          this quality is understanding.

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e796">
          Again, 
          it is impossible 
          that an effect is more perfect than its cause. 
          But cognition is sometimes
          more perfect than the known object and the cognitive potency,
          if it is a distinct thing from the cognitive potency, 
          therefore it is not able to be caused 
          by a potency or an object.

          Against this, 
          cognition is divisible or indivisible. 
          If indivisible, 
          then from what ever it is produced, 
          it is totally produced,
          otherwise 
          the same thing would be produced twice 
          and one cause would be superfluous 
          on account of another from which it is totally produced.
          If divisible, 
          then since nothing divisible 
          is divisible infinitum, 
          as he says in agreement, 
          it follows that it reaches 
          to an indivisible cognition, 
          and about this it should be asked 
          whether it is caused totally by the object 
          or not, etc.

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e837">
          Again, 
          if everything cognitive in man is a cognitive potency, 
          but another cognition of a man is cognitive, 
          therefore the other cognition of a man 
          is a cognitive potency. <!-- translation difficult. is it "cognition of a man" or "a man's cognition" ?? -->

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e850">
          Again, 
          this term <mentioned>cognitive</mentioned> 
          he calls either 
          the efficient, material, or formal, or final cause.
          Not the first because then nothing will be cognitive 
          except that which one actually knows.
          Not the second or the fourth, as is clear,
          therefore in the third mode.
          And as a consequence 
          the same thing which is cognitive
          is cognition, 
          when something is known in act, 
          therefore understanding is an intellective potency.

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1093-d1e871">
          Again, 
          if something is caused by something seen, 
          it either acts equivocally or univocally.
          If univocally, 
          then they are of the same ratio 
          and thus a white wall would appear  
          by its own whiteness, 
          and thus it would represent falsely 
          because when two qualities are of the same species 
          and another thing will have been some kind of thing through one remainder,
          will be such a thing through the remainder. <!-- translation messy here -->
          If the agent is equivocal,
          either the vision is more perfect or less perfect. 
          If more perfect, 
          then the effect will be more perfect 
          than its effective cause. 
          If less perfect, 
          then the vision will be less perfect than the whiteness. 
          The consequent is false.

          This is clear through the circular motion of an stick on fire

          whose natural cause, 
          as he says, 
          is this 
          because the color of one part of the stick 
          existing in one place causes its likeness in the head of the one seeing
          and again existing in another place causes another, 
          which borders the likeness of the preceding in the head
          and in the third place a third is caused, 
          to which when bordering one another in this manner 
          one color of a circle appears 
          which remains in the head of the one seeing, 
          while the entire time measures one circle, 
          and therefore it appears to the one seeing 
          that this part is similar in any part of the circulation. 
          Therefore in this case,

          as external to the one seeing <!-- videntis/videre? -->.
          The consequence is denied, 
          the cause of which is because 
          the one seeing extrinsic color

          see the species and the color of which it is,

          To the first, 
          it is said that form

          because it is in a material subject 
          and through the opposite 
          the material thing is said to be some perfection of the material subject.
          In the third mode the form is said to be immaterial which 
          which is naturally separated from matter and the material thing through the opposite. 
          In the first and second mode, 
          the material and immaterial form are of the same species. 
          In the third mode, 
          we speak either about the substantial or accidental form. 
          In the first mode,
