          Whether the eternal love of God is possible for man?

          Whether the eternal love of God is possible for man?
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e4146">
          It was argued 
          that not because no man is able to be certain 
          that God eternally loves them, 
          therefore.
          Consequence is clear 
          because the security that this will be so 
          is included in the eternal love of God 
          according to 
          <cit>
            <ref>
              <name>Augustinum</name>,
              <title>De trinitate</title>
            </ref>
          </cit>
          and through
          <cit>
            <ref>
              <name>Anselmum</name>, 
              <title>De casu dyaboli</title></ref>
            <bibl>XXX</bibl>
          </cit>.
          The antecedent is proved 
          because if someone is able to have security of this type 
          this would be beyond the limits of a creature 
          insomuch that God would not be able to annihlate him, 
          which is inconvenient. 
          I prove because 
          <name>Petrus</name> is
          for example is such a person 
          who has this kind of security,
          and he argues this proposition,
          it is possible that God will annihilate the punishment <!-- poenam -->
          The proof is 
          that from this the impossible follow. 
          For the proof follows, 
          God will annihilate the punishment, 
          therefore he will erroneously think 
          that he will eternally have this love, 
          therefore God who made him thus to think this 
          deceives him, 
          therefore the Truth deceives someone, 
          which is impossible and 
          against

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e169">
          In this question 
          there is not difficult hiding for the theologian, 
          for it happens that the ultimate supernatural end of man 
          is the clear enjoyment of the divine essence in itself 
          in which the highest possible beatitude exists, 
          as 
          <ref>
            <name>Anselm</name> says in 2 
            <title>Cur Deus homo</title>, 
            in the beginning

          <cit>
            <quote>
              that the natural creature or nature has been made just by God,
              so that while enjoying him he will be blessed
              ought not to be denied
            </quote>
            <bibl>
              Anselm,

          And
          <ref>
            <title>Monologion</title> 76
          </ref> 
          proves that God 
          to the rational creature loving God as he ought 
          <unclear>gives</unclear> <!-- gives instead of dabitur?? will be given-->
          as a reward God himself, 
          so that such a creature may enjoy 
          God without end
          is most foolish to doubt.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e4254">
          To the argument in the opposition
          (which 
          has made much deformity 
          while not having much meaning
          unless the following, 
          how there is security in beatitude), 
          it should be said 
          that this proposition, 
          <name>Peter</name> is secure about his eternal beatitude, 
          is able to be explained in two ways. 
          <!-- should this be a break -->
          First Peter believes without any doubt that he will always be blessed 
          and thus he will be in the truth of the matter.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e4279">
          In another mode thus,
          <name>Peter</name> believes without any doubt 
          that he will always be bless 
          and thus he will be 
          and it is impossible 
          that it is otherwise. 
          
          All the blessed have the first type of security from their beatitude,
          they do not have the second
          nor is some creature able to have it 
          because 
          if such adhesion or estimation were had,
          then the creature would be deceived 
          about the fact that it is impossible 
          that they are not blessed, 
          since every creature as long as it is 
          is freely conserved by God 
          by a dependence which is not able to be resolved.
          Whence this, 
          today God conserves freely the soul of Christ, 
          just as he ever did. 
          From this
          the following conclusions should be conceded.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e228">
          This is contingent, 
          <name>Peter</name> was blessed 
          and is true and always was true.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e237">
          Similarly, 
          this is contingent, 
          the soul of Christ will be blessed according to one life 
          just as it was elsewhere declared
          because if these propositions 
          and similar necessary things are explained, 
          then they are explained 
          through propositions, 
          some of which are contingent.
          
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e252">
          And when in the end of the argument it is shown
          <pb ed="#B" n="262-v"/>
          <cb ed="#B" n="a"/>
          that <quote>this is impossible, 
          that God will annihilate <name>Peter</name>, 
          because from this the impossible follows, 
          for it follows that God will annihilate Peter, 
          therefore Peter erred, 
          therefore God deceived him</quote>, 
          the consequent is false, 
          and the consequence is from <ref><name>Augustine</name></ref>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e266">
          To the same 
          is say three things. 
          In the first place 
          that the first consequence <unclear>validates nothing</unclear>, <!-- nihil valet --> 
          God will annihilate <name>Peter</name>, 
          therefore <name>Peter</name> erroneously thins 
          his beatitude will always be, 
          it is necessary to add some proposition 
          and then this <unclear>copulative</unclear> will be one 
          where the antecedent is sufficient for this consequent.
          Whence this consequence should be conceded, 
          God will annihilate <name>Peter</name> 
          and Peter thought that he would be and will be forever, 
          therefore <name>Peter</name> erred and was deceived.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e4381">
          In the second place, 
          I say to this argument
          that this second consequence is valid, 
          <name>Peter</name> erred, 
          therefore God deceived him 
          as a partial cause.
          I prove this is the following way,
          if <name>Peter</name> errered, 
          the there was some erroneous knowledge in the soul of <name>Peter</name>. 
          But every thing which every was in the soul of <name>Peter</name> 
          was from God as an efficient cause, 
          therefore God caused this error. 
          But this is to deceive, 
          therefore God deceived him, 
          for in this way we say, 
          <mentioned>he deceived me</mentioned>, 
          that is he caused in 
          me an erroneous estimation. 
          In the same way about <name>Socrates</name> 
          and about anything which coexists with error in us.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-d1e322">
          In the third place, 
          these days this term <mentioned>to mislead</mentioned> or <!-- these days / recently for "modo" -->
          <mentioned>to deceive</mentioned> etc 
          is understood both properly and improperly,
          when properly it is explained as the saying for the causing of the error, 
          when improperly for the vicious and disordered causing of error, 
          and in this way God is not able to deceive. 
          But the consequence of 
          <ref xml:id="beq3sc-d1e1444-Rd1e434">
            <name>Augustine</name> 
            to the mind of the  <unclear>angeli</unclear>, 
            de 83 questions, 14
          </ref> 
          thus

              if Christ deceived by showing the disciples

          And this consequence is valid 
          and both the antecedent and the consequent 
          are impossible. 
          And through this is clear the 
          distinction of

          how God deceived through bad angels and through bad men,
