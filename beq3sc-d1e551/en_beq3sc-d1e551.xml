          Whether contraries are able 
          to be coextended in the same subject?

          That they are, 
          some contrary is able to be remitted. 
          But one thing is remitted 
          unless account of the intension of another. 
          The minor is proved through 
          the <name>Commentator</name> 9 <title>Physics</title>, in comment 45, 
          where he says that a decrease in anything is 
          on account of the mixture of its contrary, 
          and the same in comment 19 of the same book, 
          and in many other places of the same book. 
          And thus in every mixed thing there is one 
          element predominating to which the form is attributed 
          and another which is predominated, 
          just as is clear in <ref>book 10 of the <title>metaphysics</title>, in comment 23</ref>
          and in book 1 <title>de caelo</title>, in comment 7, 
          where it is frequently held 
          that every mixed thing dies according to the mode of the dominating element, 
          therefore in every mixed thing there are contrary elements 
          and two contrary qualities 
          because unless the qualities will be contrary there, 
          the contrary elements will not be there.
          the consequent is false.

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e551-d1e4195">
          It should be responded to this 
          that the remission through admixture 
          is able to be understood in two ways.
          Either that its contrary coextends with it in the same matter 
          and this is impossible. 
          Or that the mixture is of a contrary agent 
          into a passive, 
          and thus I concede that every that becomes less, 
          becomes less through the admixture of its contrary 
          through which <supplied>the response</supplied> to the first is clear.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e551-d1e173">
          To the second it is said that 
          no element is a qualitative part of the mixed, 
          but only qualitative,
          and any element thus remitted 
          through the mixture of its contrary 
          is a mixed body, 
          and therefore some part of the mixed 
          is mixed. 
          Whence when something is composed from two <unclear>transitory</unclear> contraries 
          according to itself alone, 
          then some part is remitted and mixed.

          To the understanding of 
          <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, 
          it is not possible that something mixed 
          is essentially composed from contraries.

          in comment 23, 
          I say that he understands through the impossible what is difficult 
          and <name ref="#Galen">Galen</name> understood through the possible what is easy,
