          That yes, 
          it is argued
          because it is erroneous, 
          as is clear in 
          <ref>
            8 book of 
            <title>On the free will</title>
          </ref>, 
          where he teaches 
          that God is not able to remove 
          the rectitude of the will from the will, 
          and nevertheless he holds 
          that this something different from the will, 
          which is erroneous 
          because God is able to separate 
          everything that is totally distinct from something else, 
          therefore etc.
        </p>

          Against, 
          therefore either it is effectively 
          from the will or not. 
          If thus, 
          contra, 
          it is not in the power of the will 
          to cause rectitude in itself
          but to preserve, as he says.
          Again affections are created by God, 
          <ref>
            <title>de concordia</title>, capitulo 17
          </ref>
          therefore etc.

          <cb ed="#P" n="a"/>
          Similarly, 
          if it causes rectitude, 
          it does so either by willing or not willing.
          If by willing, 
          and no one wishes rectitude 
          unless having rectitude, 
          it has before 
          what it causes, 
          and this is the argument of the same one 
          in 
          <ref>
            <title>De concordia</title>, 
            chapter 13

          If rectitude is not effective from the will, 
          then it should not be thought of us a free will, 
          which is in opposition to 
          <ref>
            <name>Augustine</name>, 
            in the first book of the 
            <title>Retractions</title>,

          It is said that 
          it depends on the will

          not with respect to production.

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e113-d1e243">
          Against this, 
          it is in the power of sinners to produce contrition,
          and every contrition is rectitude of the will, 
          therefore etc. 
          This is confirmed 
          because the rectitude of the will 
          is to will what God wills it to will, 
          <ref>
            <title>On free will</title>, 
            chapter 8

          unless he wishes to have,
          he has from the will,

          he puts five propositions. 
          The first is that 
          to act against the will of God 
          even what we think the lightest moral sin 
          is of so great a weight 
          that it is not able to happen 
          that there is salvation in an infinity of worlds. <!-- translations review -->

        <p xml:id="beq3sc-d1e113-d1e344">
          But against this, 
          then any sin is of infinite badness in intention 
          because if of finite badness, 
          then the salvation of some worlds 
          will it be so good, 
          just as this will be bad.

          Second proposition,

          is a greater evil than

          Again, 
          he proves that God is not able to destroy

          because this is either by willing 
          or not willing.
          Not by not willing as is clear.
          Not by willing 
          because if this is the case, 
          then he wishes that he does it,
          and from whose will 
          he wishes to withdraw the rectitude, 
          he does not wish that keeps the rectitude. 
          But to keep the rectitude 
          is will just as God will it to will, 
          therefore if God 
          destroys the rectitude from the will, 
          he does not will 
          that it will what he wishes it to will.

          the devil is obstinate in evil, 
          therefore he wishes unjustly, 
          and God wishes the antecedent 
          and that the consequence is valid, 
          therefore it follows 
          that he wills the consequent.

          Again, 
          against this form of arguing <name>Anselmi</name> 
          he argues thus,
          because when God removes grace, 
          either he wishes one not to have grace
          or he does not wish. 
          If he wishes him not, therefore etc., 
          for then he is not a debtor of grace. 
          Against, 
          he commands him always to have grace. 
          If he wishes that he has grace, 
          then he does not remove it.

        <p>
          Therefore to this proposition about the rectitude of the will,

          from the will having grace "ipsa invita" <!-- translation check -->
          for his ordained power.
          And thus is the end of the question.
